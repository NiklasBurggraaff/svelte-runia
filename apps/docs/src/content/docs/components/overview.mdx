Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

## Structure

The following outlines the structure used for each component page.

### Overview

The overview contain:

-   Links to the source code and the ARIA design pattern
-   A high-level description of the component
-   An <span class="text-runic-gradient">interactive example</span> of the component
    -   Use the controls to change the props and see how the component responds
    -   View the source code of the example in the "Code" tab
-   A list of the main features of the component

<Card title="[Component]">
<Links componentName="" ariaLink="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/" />

<div class="py-4 text-xl text-[var(--sl-color-gray-2)]">[One sentence description].</div>

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Preview" icon="laptop">
        <InteractivePreviewExample client:load />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Code" icon="seti:svelte">
        ```svelte
        // MyComponent.svelte
        <script lang="ts">
            let { value, disabled } = $props();
        </script>

        <button
            class="rounded-xl border bg-transparent px-4 py-1"
            onclick={() => alert(`Hello ${value}`)}>Say Hello</button
            {disabled}
        >
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Features

<Features
    features={[
        "Amazing feature.",
    ]}
/>
</Card>

### Usage

This explains the basic usage of the component.
Particularly noting which components to use as children of the other components,
and which props are required.

Here _must_ is used to indicate a required and _can_ is used to indicate something that is optional.

### API

The API of each Svelte component is documented.

It starts my showing the HTML element that the component renders to.
If there is another element the component can render to, it will be shown as well.
Hover over the <span class="inline-flex"><Icon name="information" /></span>
to see the condition when the other element is used.

<Card title="[Component]">
    <API.Introduction
        name="[Component]"
        element={{
            default: "[Default]",
            other: "[Other]",
            condition: "This would show when the other element is used"
        }}
        description="..."
    />
</Card>

Next, the props are documented, with their type, default value (or "-" if there is none), and a description of it's usage.

-   <span class="text-runic-gradient">\*</span> is shown next to a required prop.
-   <span class="text-sm">(bindable)</span> is shown to indicate that the prop is bindable.
-   <span class="text-runic-gradient mb-2 pr-1 text-sm">(x)</span> is shown next to group of props where
    one is required.

<Card title="Props">
    <API.Props
        props={[
            {
                name: "[name]",
                type: "[type]",
                defaultValue: undefined,
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                name: "defaultProp",
                type: "[type]",
                defaultValue: "[value]",
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                name: "requiredProp",
                required: true,
                type: "[type]",
                defaultValue: undefined,
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                name: "bindableProp",
                type: "[type]",
                bindable: true,
                defaultValue: undefined,
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                name: "groupProp1",
                required: "group1",
                type: "[type]",
                defaultValue: undefined,
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                name: "groupProp2",
                required: "group1",
                type: "[type]",
                defaultValue: undefined,
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            }
        ]}
    />
</Card>

All data attributes are documented in the same way as props.

-   The <span class="inline-flex"><Icon name="seti:ignored" /></span> icon
    is shown next to an attribute (always prefixed with `svelte-runia-`) used for the
    functioning of the component.
    -   These attributes **should not be used**.

<Card title="Data attributes">
    <API.DataAttributes
        attributes={[
            {
                name: "data-[name]",
                public: true,
                values: "[values]",
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                name: "data-svelte-runia-[name]",
                values: "[values]",
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            }
        ]}
    />
</Card>

### Accessibility

An important aspect of accessibility is keyboard navigation.
All keyboard interactions handled by the component are documented.

When multiple keys are described, they are separated by a "/".
Many keyboard interactions require a condition to be met
, such as an element being focussed on, before the action is performed.

<Card title="Keyboard interactions">
    <A11y.Keyboard
        interactions={[
            {
                keys: ["[key]"],
                condition: undefined,
                action: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                keys: ["[key1]", "[key2]"],
                condition: undefined,
                action: "Lorem ipsum"
            },
            {
                keys: ["[key]"],
                condition: "[condition]",
                action: "Lorem ipsum"
            }
        ]}
    />
</Card>

Any other events (not `onkeydown`) are also documented.

<Card title="Other events">
    <A11y.Events
        events={[
            {
                component: "[Component]",
                event: "[event]",
                action: "Lorem ipsum"
            }
        ]}
    />
</Card>

Lastly, all ARIA attributes used to comply with the ARIA design pattern are documented.
These are grouped by the component they are applied to.
The description describes when the attribute is used and what value it will have.

<Card title="ARIA attributes">
    <A11y.ARIAAttributes
        attributes={[
            {
                name: "aria-[name]",
                type: "[type]",
                description: "Lorem ipsum"
            }
        ]}
    />
</Card>

### Examples

At the bottom of the page, there are examples of tasks you might want to
accomplish with the component.

These contain code snippets, marking the relevant parts of the code.
A preview of the component, using the code snippets, is shown in the "Preview" tab.

<Card title="Hello World">
    <Example>
        <div slot="code">
            ```svelte "Hello World!"
            <p>Hello World!</p>
            ```
        </div>
        <div slot="preview">
            <p>Hello World!</p>
        </div>
    </Example>
</Card>
